<strong>Welcome, and thank you for your interest in the @lang('messages.IndexTitle') project!</strong>

<br><br>Did you ever notice how some parts of English-speaking North America have strongly distinguishable accents compared to British Columbia? Probably. But have you ever noticed that certain regions of B.C. seem to have some slight differences in the way words are pronounced? Probably not. The differences in accent in British Columbia are extremely subtle, and there is not much information about how and where those differences can occur. This study is being conducted by Dr. Bob Pritchard (UBC School of Music) and Dr. Molly Babel (UBC Linguistics). If you decide to participate in this study, you will be asked to answer a few brief questions about yourself, and then record yourself reading a short passage in English. The passage will take roughly 3-4 minutes to read aloud.
