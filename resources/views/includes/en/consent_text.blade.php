<p>This project is about discovering different regional dialects in British Columbia. If you chose to participate in this study, you will be asked to read a short story over the phone or through the browser on your computer, in addition to providing some demographic and personal data about your language use and history. We will analyze your speech patterns to better understand the dialect landscape in Western Canada. This project is supported by the Social Sciences and Research Council of Canada.</p>

<p>This study is being conducted by Dr. Molly Babel and Dr. Bob Pritchard, who are both professors at the University of British Columbia. If you have questions about the study, please contact Molly at molly.babel@ubc.ca or Bob at bob@mail.ubc.ca.</p>

<p>Your participation is entirely voluntary and optional. If you choose to participate in this study, your doing so is confidential and we do not collect identifying information.
