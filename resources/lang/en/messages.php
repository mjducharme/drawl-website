These recordings will help us understand how languages change over time, how languages differ from each other with respect to small details of pronunciation, and, more generally, how speech is represented and processed in the brain. If you decide to participate in this study, you will be asked to answer a few brief questions about yourself, record yourself reading a short passage in [name of language], and then talking spontaneously in the same language for a few minutes. The passage will take roughly 5-6 minutes to read aloud. For the spontaneous speech section, you are asked to talk for no less than 5 minutes and no more than 10 minutes. <br><br> To participate in the experiment, please click the button below.",
